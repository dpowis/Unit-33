                        <center><strong>Above: Anna's study painting of La Digue by Leon Spilleart<br />Acrylic paint on paper </strong></center>

                        <p>La Digue is on of the simplest paintings Leon Spilleart has done in term of blending and texture. The smooth distribution of colours creates a flat effect which seems almost cartoon like. The straight lines used on what is supposed to be more uneven also contribute to its unrealistic features.</p>

                        <p>Similar to <i>Marine, Plage a Maree Basse,</i> and the <i>Curve of the Esplanade</i>, the point of view is the same wherein the foreground highly dominates the background. The beach is seen to stretch from the mid-right to the top-left of the painting and continues on the horizon. What catches my attention is the straight shore-line which looks almost unrealistic as if abruptly stretches in a ninety degree angle.</p>

                        <p>The plain flat colours used in the shore contrasts the rest of the painting. The beige in the sands of the beach, the black in the lower left, and the house at the edge of the shore is fairly distributed with just one colour. Alternatively, the skies and seas have more blending of colours. Leon Spilleart's use of colour in the rules of brightness and darkness is also quite surprising. I perceive the painting to have a dark mood considering the dark skies and seas. In comparison with the rest, the colour brightness of the sands does not show a dark night with the use of really light beige.</p>

                        <p>Another contrasting element is the texture as the plain colours have just one depth. On the other hand, the sea, with its white lines which represents waves, has more character and movement. The night background has body, despite its dark shades of blues and blacks. The contrast between the techniques, complement each other as it shows its own unique composure. The plain and stagnant sands and house stand out from the movement of the waves and clouds.</p>

                        <p>The position of the house in the edge is almost alarming, considering that it coudl be flooded any time. Despite its centre point, it does not catch my full attention due to its flat charactertistic. However, I regard the waves as the essence of the painting, with the it beautifully blends with the water. </p>
