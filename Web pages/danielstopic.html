        <h1>Planes</h1>
        <p>From travelling commercial to business trips to flying with birds, planes come in all
        shapes and sizes</p>
        <br />
        <p><pre>EasyJet and RyanAir are the <strong>amongst the cheapest airlines</strong> to fly with and can make travelling
        easier and more affordable, depending on where you are travelling.
        Travelling longer distances requires different airlines which can cost more money.</pre></p>

        <p>There's this guy in <style="color:#">France</style="color:#"> that has a small-open plane that is powered by a small turbine at the back
        of the plane and he has trained these geese to fly with him to migrate them to their needed areas
        in the east or the west </p>
